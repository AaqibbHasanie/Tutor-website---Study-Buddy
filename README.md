“Study Buddy” is a website which aims to connect university students
looking to work as part-time tutors or any tutor looking for teaching
opportunities with potential students. This process is informally being
done via social media platforms such as WhatsApp groups and
Facebook forums and often involves long communication channels via
a middle-person who mediates the bargaining between students and
tutors. “Study Buddy” will optimize and streamline this entire process
by eliminating the middle-man and allowing students to directly
choose who they wish to be tutored by as well as allowing tutors to
easily target their intended pool of students. It will serve as a timeefficient and organized solution to the conventional process of
manually searching for tutors/students or having to involve a middleman in case of no access to social media forums. Following use cases are involved in this website:
